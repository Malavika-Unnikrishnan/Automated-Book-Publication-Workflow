THE CANOE BUILDER

This is a test.
Enclosed by its forty-mile ring of coral, this vast expanse was a sea in itself: a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure in light airs. And it was his, for he had landed here only yesterday. The women, children, and youths, indeed the entire tribe, were busy along the blazing beach, fishing with nets, playing games, or working on their taro patches; all were now his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand, and his the empty houses where war canoes had once rested on their rollers.

As his eyes moved from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the lagoon, he faced the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the distant sea line lay Palm Tree, invisible—an island beautiful as a dream, yet teeming with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby, looking up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he understood that the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women, boys, and children like himself defenseless, without a leader or protector. Then, yesterday, from the northern sea, this strange new figure arrived in an unfamiliar boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago while fishing. The women said he was sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.

The child knew nothing of who these gods might be, nor did he care. Alone with this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he asked directly, with all the simplicity of childhood: “Taori,” little Tari said, “who are you?” (é kamina tai)

Had Dick answered fully, would the child have understood the strange words of the story he might have told him? "Tari," he might have begun, "I come from people beyond the world you know. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, Tari, I was left alone with an old sailor on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles north, out of sight. There we lived, and there I grew to be a boy. Kearney, that was his name, taught me to fish and spear fish, and he made me playthings: little ships unlike the canoes of the islands. And then, Tari, one day long ago Katafa came, the girl who was blown away from here in a storm. She lived with us until Kearney died, and then we two were alone. She taught me her language, which is the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We loved one another and might have lived forever at Marua had not a great ship arrived there, filled with bad men, men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to cut the trees. They rose up, killed the white men with them, and burned the ship; we escaped from them in our boat, taking everything we loved, even the little ships. We steered for Karolin, led by the lagoon light in the sky."

But Dick could not tell Tari this, or at least not all of it. The very name Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language he had spoken as a child. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was all but forgotten, nearly lost in the luminous haze that was his past. For men long shipwrecked and alone, the past often blurs and fogs. For Dick, it began only with Katafa’s arrival at Marua. Everything before that was forgotten, as if consumed by the great blaze of tropical light bathing the island and sea, by the storms sweeping the coconut groves, and by the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been entirely forgotten, were it not for the small ships he had made as playthings for the boy who was now a man.

He looked down at the questioning child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”

“I do not know,” the child replied. “I ask as I breathe, but no big folk—no madyana—will ever answer Tari’s questions—Ai, the fish!” His nimble mind had already moved on, drawn by the cries of other children hauling in a net, and he rose and trotted away.

Dick turned his gaze north again. The child’s question had stirred his mind, and he saw once more the schooner that had put into Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesian crew. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy that Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He recalled their landing on this beach yesterday, and the women and children swarming around him, the man they believed was sent by the gods to be their chief and leader.

Yet, as he gazed towards the north, the memory of the men from whom he and the girl had escaped stained the beauty of the sea and sky. There was no immediate fear of the men who had taken possession of Palm Tree; they had no canoes. But they would build canoes—they surely would. And just as surely, they would see the distant, mirror-like blaze of Karolin lagoon in the sky, exactly as he had seen it, and they would come. It might be a very long time, but they would come.

Dick was almost like them, a kanaka, a savage; yet the white man was still there within him. He could think ahead, consider a subject from all angles, and imagine. That was why he had sent a canoe that morning across to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three old men too old for war, yet expert canoe-builders. That was why, gazing at the tribe in full congregation, his eyes had brightened at the nearly hundred youths ripening to war age. But beneath all this, illuminating and animating his mind, raising his daring to eagle heights, lay his passion for Katafa, his other self, more dear to him than life itself—threatened, however vaguely, yet still threatened.

His mind turned to the purpose of the war canoes he planned: would they defend the lagoon, or carry the fight to the enemy before they could even threaten?

A hand fell upon his shoulder, and turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa. A lock of her dark hair, escaped from the elastic vine binding it, blew back in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her eyes, luminous and dark, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the point where he had been gazing—the due-north sea line.

“Look!” Katafa said.

At long intervals and under certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the sea line, became visible from Karolin through mirage. Last evening they had seen it, and now again it was beginning to live and bloom—a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea’s dazzle that deepened by degrees and hardened until, as if sketched by some unseen painter, the island appeared, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.

Their minds untutored, knowing nothing of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, which now rose so strangely beyond the far sea line, as if to gaze at them. They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as nightmare forms. They felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and again they heard the yells of the Melanesians, mad with rum stolen from the schooner they had brought in and burned. There, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, that lovely picture which revealed nothing of the demons that still inhabited it.

Then, as Dick gazed upon this loveliness, which was simultaneously a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him—that was nothing. They had threatened Katafa—that was everything—and they still threatened her.

Someday they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo what instinct told him. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon’s mirror-light in the sky, they would come. Those men had no women, and here were women. Instinct half-whispered to him that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided for its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed or desire or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only among savages, but also from the wolves of civilization. To Dick, there was no world beyond the waters that ringed the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history save for his own short life and Katafa’s. Yet, even in that brief life, he had learned to dread men, and he had grasped the foundation of all history—man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Then, gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and pass. Suddenly, it vanished like a light blown out. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the lagoon water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe-builders, and leaving the coral, they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
